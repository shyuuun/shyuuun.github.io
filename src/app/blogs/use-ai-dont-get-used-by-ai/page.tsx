          <blockquote className="my-8 border-l-4 border-primary pl-5 font-mono text-base leading-7 text-foreground/80">
            “No one is manually coding anymore.”
          </blockquote>

          <p className="mb-4">
            As a junior developer who was still new to the field, I didn’t
            believe it at first.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            I thought, “Why should I rely on AI when I might eventually forget
            how to write code?”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            My boss gave us a free Claude subscription, and during that time, we
            were using Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.6.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The more we used AI in our daily development, the more I started to
            understand what he meant.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            AI didn’t make coding unnecessary. It changed how I approached
            coding.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Instead of spending time writing repetitive boilerplate, I could ask
            AI to help me generate it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Instead of spending hours trying to understand an unfamiliar error,
            I could use AI to help me investigate it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Instead of starting everything from scratch, I could use AI to
            explore different approaches.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">But there was one thing I learned:</p>

          <p className="mb-4 font-mono text-foreground">
            Don’t let AI do the thinking for you.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            That’s when I realized that the skill isn’t necessarily about
            writing every single line of code manually anymore.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            It’s about understanding the problem, knowing what you want to
            build, reviewing what AI produces, and knowing when the answer is
            wrong.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">AI can make you faster.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">BUT</strong> if
            you stop learning and simply accept everything AI gives you, you’re
            no longer using AI to improve yourself. You’re becoming dependent on
            it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 pt-4">Remember these words:</p>

          <p className="mb-4 font-mono text-xl text-primary sm:text-2xl">
            Use AI.
            <br />
            Don’t get used by AI.
